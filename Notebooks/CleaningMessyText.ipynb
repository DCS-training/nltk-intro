    "    * Once found, they can be replaced, so this is useful for cleaning text with digitization errors.  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwriting Recognition (HWT or HRT) technologies are imperfect, so you will find errors in digitized text corpora (unless of course they've been manually reviewed and corrected).\n",
    "* **HOW? Combinations of special characters with a RegEx compiler**\n",
    "    * In programming, a *compiler* translates code from one programming language to another.  In a sense, RegEx is a language that can sit on top of Python.  RegEx works with Python data types and syntax but it also has its own special characters and methods that plain Python doesn't use.\n",
