    "There are two data types that are particularly important to understand when doing text analysis: **string** and **list**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** are sequences of characters (as in letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation marks) that are contained within single quotes (`'I am a string'`) or double quotes (`\"I'm a string too!\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** are collections of data of any type (str, int, float, dict, list, tuple, set) that are contained within square brackets (`[ ]`).  Lists can have zero or more elements, and a single list can contain elements of different data types (for example: `['hi', 123, \"bonjour !\", [], {\"A\":1, \"B\":2}, (1.5, 2.8)]`).  The elements inside lists are *ordered*, which allows us to reference them by their *index* (position - numeric, starts from 0)."
